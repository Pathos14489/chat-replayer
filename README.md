# chat-replayer
Here's a quick project I threw together over a few days to replay chatlogs. I have some rooms I made from old brony chat data from Fillydelphia as concepts for how this works. Have fun.

Sorry if it's badly made, I wanted to make it, not make it perfectly.

# How To Use

Just download the html file, and open in your browser. If you just wanna browse a history, pick a room, load it, and you're off to the races. If you want to use NovelAI, then open the network tab of your browser inspector on NAI and make a generation request, then read through the "Headers" and find the Authorization header. Copy-paste the string of nonsense after the word "Bearer " and you're good to go for AI generation. It currently uses the Room 1 module for all generations, but that's not intended forever. I'm intending to update the Room files to include an option for custom modules per room. But this is still usable so. Yeah.
